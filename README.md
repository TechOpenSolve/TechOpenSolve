# [TechOpenSolve](https://techopensolve.com/)


## Welcome to the Live Site Repository

This repository is the only location for submitting Pull Requests and raising code-related Issues without prior discussion. It deals solely with code and not real life.

Here is where all contributions from the rest of the non-code repositories, representing different categories, are integrated and deployed to the live site.

## Regular Open Source Workflow

This repo features the usual workflow of an open-source project where code-related Issues are recorded and Pull Requests are merged.

Assigning an issue to a contributor here means they are expected to work on it and submit a Pull Request that can be merged after appropriate validation.

Issues get closed after the relevant PR containing the resolution gets merged.
